# Hello, folks! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Oliver!

_I am not currently working on any public repositories. My most recent project is [vaadin-logrocket-integration(https://github.com/oliveryasuna/vaadin-logrocket-integration)._

On my free-time, I enjoy researching existing technologies to identify room for improvement or addition.
For example, I wrote [Fluent Flow](https://github.com/oliveryasuna/fluent-flow), an addon for Vaadin Flow that simplifies UI composition by offering the opportunity to write cleaner and more powerful code.
I also wrote [Gimme DOM](https://github.com/oliveryasuna/gimme-dom), an extension for Vaadin 8 enabling legacy Vaadin developers to access client-side DOM.
Similar features were adopted in later Vaadin versions.

I don't drink â˜•, but let's pretend I do so that you'll check out my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/oliveryasuna) page.
Your support helps me make the time to code great things!
