# Hello, folks! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Oliver!

I started my journey at age twelve, teaching myself x86 asm and C to exploit AhnLab's HackShield Pro. Fast-forward some number of years: I am a Java and JavaScript fullstack developer. I work as a Software Architect & Programmer at [MyDataOnly](https://mydataonly.com/), an internet privacy and security company, where I manage our cloud platform and write super secret code that I can't talk about.

I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Massachusetts Bay Community College and continue my never-ceasing education as a Computer Science student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
 
On my free-time, I enjoy researching existing technologies to identify room for improvement or addition. For example, I wrote [Gimme DOM](https://github.com/oliveryasuna/gimme-dom), an extension for Vaadin 8, enabling legacy Vaadin developers to access client-side DOM. Similar features were adopted natively in later Vaadin versions.

Currently, I am working on [Fluent Flow](https://github.com/oliveryasuna/fluent-flow), an addon for Vaadin 14+ that simplifies UI composition through shorter, more powerful code. I am also developing a [web app](https://github.com/WPI-Gordon-Library) for WPI's library.

I don't drink <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rush/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG/master/black/svg/coffee.svg" alt="coffee" width="18px"/>, but I'm going to tell you that I do so that you'll check out my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/oliveryasuna) page. I DRINK COFFEE. Thank you for your support!
