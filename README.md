# Hello, folks! 👋

Hi, I'm Oliver!

* 💻 Software Engineer at [Sferion](https://sferion.com/).
* 🎓 Research Assistent at [ASSISTments](https://new.assistments.org/).
* 🧑‍💻️ Working with Java, TypeScript, Spring, Vaadin, and more!
* ❤️ [jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/) fanatic. [Don't use Hibernate](https://www.toptal.com/java/how-hibernate-ruined-my-career).

My most recent project is [vaadin-logrocket-integration](https://github.com/oliveryasuna/vaadin-logrocket-integration).
Also, check out my [abstract algebra project](https://github.com/oliveryasuna/math).

On my free-time, I enjoy researching existing technologies to identify room for improvement or addition.
For example, I wrote [Fluent Flow](https://github.com/oliveryasuna/fluent-flow-2), an addon for Vaadin Flow that simplifies UI composition by offering the opportunity to write cleaner and more powerful code.
I also wrote [Gimme DOM](https://github.com/oliveryasuna/gimme-dom), an extension for Vaadin 8 enabling legacy Vaadin developers to access client-side DOM.
Similar features were adopted in later Vaadin versions.

I don't drink ☕, but let's pretend I do so that you'll check out my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/oliveryasuna) page.
Your support helps me make the time to code great things!
